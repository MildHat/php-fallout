"index.php" is an input form, you should load it in order to start (it loads automatically). <br />
"results.php" is an output form, it puts your character info on the screen. <br />
"vaultboy.png" is a background of the input form. <br />
"favicon.png" is an image that you see on the tab. <br />
<br />
Make sure to type your administrator user name and password in the lines 77-80 in "results.php", otherwise database fill feature won't work.
